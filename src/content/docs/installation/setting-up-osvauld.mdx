## Setting up backend

<div style="background-color: #23262f; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"> <strong>Important:</strong> Osvauld requires a PostgreSQL instance running. </div>
### Pull Image

To pull the Osvauld backend image, run the following command:

```bash
docker pull osvauld/backend:<version>
```
Change `<version>` with the docker image tag of your choice

### Start Instance
To start the Osvauld backend instance, use the following command:

```bash
docker run --name osvauld_backend \
  -d \
  -p 80:8000 \
  -e MASTER_DB_HOST=<db_host> \
  -e MASTER_DB_NAME=<db_name> \
  -e MASTER_DB_USER=<db_user> \
  -e MASTER_DB_PASSWORD=<db_password> \
  -e MASTER_DB_PORT=<db_port> \
  -e MASTER_SSL_MODE=require \
  -e AUTH_SECRET=<auth_secret> \
  osvauld/backend:<version>
  ```
Replace the following placeholders with your actual values:

-    `db_host>`: The hostname or IP address of your PostgreSQL instance.
-    `db_name`: The name of the database to use.
-    `db_user`: The username for accessing the database.
-    `db_password`: The password for the specified user.
-    `db_port`: The port number on which the PostgreSQL instance is running.
-    `auth_secret`: The secret for generating tokens. Should have a minimum length of 32 characters.

The backend will start and listen on port 80. Make sure to configure the appropriate environment variables for connecting to your PostgreSQL instance.

## Setup first user

When setting up your self-hosted Osvauld application for the first time, you need to create an initial admin user to access the admin panel. Follow the steps below to create the first admin user:

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where your Osvauld backend is hosted, followed by `/admin`. For example, if your Osvauld backend is hosted at <span style="color: #ff6b6b;">`https://yourdomain.com`</span>, go to <span style="color: #ff6b6b;">`https://yourdomain.com/admin`</span>.

2. If there are no existing users in the system, you will be presented with a form to create a new admin user.

3. Fill in the required information in the form, including:
   - Username
   - Name
   - Password

<div style="background-color: #23262f; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Make sure to choose a strong password and remember it or write it down in a secure place, as you will need it to log in to the admin panel. There is no way to recover this for now.
</div>

4. Once you have filled in the required information, click on the "Submit" button to create the admin user.

5. If the form submission is successful and there are no other users in the system, the first admin user will be created.

<div style="background-color: #23262f; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This route is a one-time use only route. Once an admin user is created, the `/admin` route will no longer display the user creation form and will instead show you the admin already exists.
</div>

6. After the admin user is created, you can proceed to install the Osvauld web extension in your browser.

7. Once the web extension is installed, open it for the first time. The extension will prompt you to enter the domain of the Osvauld backend server.

<div style="background-color: #23262f; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  <strong>Important:</strong> Enter the domain <strong>without the forward slash</strong>. For example, if your Osvauld backend is hosted at <span style="color: #ff6b6b;">https://yourdomain.com</span>, enter <span style="color: #ff6b6b;">https://yourdomain.com</span> without the trailing slash.
</div>

8. After entering the backend server domain, the extension will ask you to provide your username and password.

<div style="background-color: #23262f; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  <strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to use the same email address and password you provided during the admin user creation process when registering your account through the web extension.
</div>

Fill in your username and password, and click on the submit button to complete the registration process.

That's it! You have now successfully created the first admin user for your self-hosted Osvauld application and registered your account using the web extension. Remember to keep your login credentials secure and avoid sharing them with unauthorized individuals.
