title: "osvauld: Secure, Shareable Credential Management"
---

## Purpose

osvauld is designed from the ground up to facilitate secure credential sharing within organizations.

## The Problem

Credentials are often shared insecurely, leading to:

* **Security risks:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized parties.
* **Management difficulties:** Lack of centralized control and visibility over credential usage.
* **Inefficient key rotation:** Cumbersome and time-consuming to update credentials.

## What osvauld Offers

* **Fine-grained access control:** Precise control over who can view and modify specific credentials.
* **Comprehensive access visibility:**  Robust audit logging to track all credential activity.
* **Easy key rotation:** Streamlined processes for updating credentials.
* **Self Hosted**: osvauld can be self-hosted, ensuring maximum control over data.

## Key Principles

* **Zero-knowledge architecture:** osvauld never has access to unencrypted credentials, ensuring maximum privacy and security.
* **OpenPGP standard:** Adherence to well-established encryption protocols ([https://sequoia-pgp.org/](https://sequoia-pgp.org/)).
* **Client-side decryption:**  Credentials are decrypted only within the user's device.
