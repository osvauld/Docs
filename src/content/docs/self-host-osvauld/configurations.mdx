## Configurations
<strong> How to configure environment variables for self-hosted Osvauld.</strong>
<p>

Osvauld accepts all configurations via environment variables. For a minimal self-hosted instance, at least MASTER_DB_NAME, MASTER_DB_USER, MASTER_DB_PASSWORD, MASTER_DB_HOST and AUTH_SECRET must be defined. However, you can configure additional settings to activate more features as needed.
