# Credential

A credential consists of two parts: a common part for all users stored in the `credentials` table and a unique part for each user it has been shared with, stored in the `fields` table.

The `credentials` table contains the following relevant fields:
- `id` (primary key)
- `name`
- `description` 
- `credential_type`
- `folder_id` (foreign key referencing the `folders` table)
- `domain`

The `fields` table contains all the relevant parts of the credentials, including:
- `id` (primary key)
- `field_name`
- `field_value`
- `field_type`
- `credential_id` (foreign key referencing the `credentials` table)
- `user_id` (foreign key referencing the `users` table)

The `fields` table can have multiple rows for sensitive and metadata fields. Sensitive details are always handled with care and are fetched only when required, while metadata is loaded when a user clicks on a folder.

Currently there are two types of Credentials:
- `Login` Which is used to login to websites 
- `Other` Which includes all other types of Credentials like database, api-key etc.

# Access Management

The access to credentials is inferred from the `credential_access` table, and only the credentials that a user has access to are fetched.

The `credential_access` table contains the following relevant fields:
- `id` (primary key)
- `credential_id` (foreign key referencing the `credentials` table)
- `user_id` (foreign key referencing the `users` table)
- `access_type` (manager/reader)
- `group_id` (foreign key referencing the `groupings` table)
- `folder_id` (foreign key referencing the `folders` table)

Access to a credential can be granted through:
- Direct sharing of the credential to a user
- Direct sharing of a folder containing the credential
- Sharing the credential to a group
- Sharing a folder containing the credential to a group

By using the `credential_access` table, the system ensures that users can only access the credentials they have been granted permission to view or modify.
