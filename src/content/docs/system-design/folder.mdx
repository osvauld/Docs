title: Folder Concept
---


In our system, a folder is a collection of credentials. It is used to organize and manage access to related credentials.
The folder metadata and access information are stored in the `folder` and `folder_access` tables,
while the actual credentials are stored separately.
There are two types of folder private and shared. Shared folders by default will be shared with super admin to prevent data loss.

## Folder Table

The `folder` table stores the metadata for each folder. The relevant columns in the `folder` table are:

- `pk`: The primary key of the folder, uniquely identifying each folder.
- `name`: The name of the folder.
- `created_by`: A foreign key referencing the user who created the folder.

## Folder Access Table

The `folder_access` table manages the access permissions for folders. The relevant columns in the `folder_access` table are:

- `pk`: The primary key of the folder access entry.
- `folder_id`: A foreign key referencing the `pk` of the corresponding folder.
- `user_id`: A foreign key referencing the user who has been granted access to the folder.
- `access_type`: The type of access the user has to the folder (e.g., "manager", "read").
- `group_id`: A foreign key referencing the group that has been granted access to the folder if any.

## Credential Sharing

When a folder is shared with other users or groups, all the credentials within that folder are automatically 
shared with those users or group members.
The access type defined in the `folder_access` table is inherited by the credentials within the folder.

The `credentials` table stores the actual credential information. The relevant columns in the `credentials` table are:

- `pk`: The primary key of the credential.
- `name`: The name of the credential.
- `description`: A description of the credential.
- `folder_id`: A foreign key referencing the `pk` of the folder to which the credential belongs.

<strong>Note:</strong>When a new credential is added to a folder, it automatically inherits the access permissions of the folder 
and is shared with all users or groups who have been granted access to the folder.

## Folder Sharing with Groups

When a folder is shared with a group, all members of the group inherit the access type defined for the folder in the
 `folder_access` table. An entry is added to the `folder_access` table for each member of the group,
 granting them access to the folder and its credentials.

## Creating a Folder

When a new folder is created, the following steps occur:

1. A new entry is inserted into the `folder` table with the provided metadata, such as the folder name and the user who created it.
2. An entry is added to the `folder_access` table, granting the creator of the folder an access type of "manager".

## Sharing a Folder

When a folder is shared with other users or groups, the following steps occur:

1. For each user or group member that the folder is shared with, a new entry is added to the `folder_access` table.
2. The `folder_id` column in the `folder_access` table is set to the `pk` of the shared folder.
3. The `user_id` column in the `folder_access` table is set to the `pk` of the user or group member being granted access.
4. The `access_type` column in the `folder_access` table is set to the appropriate access level (e.g., "read", "write").

By organizing credentials into folders and managing access through the `folder_access` table, our system provides a flexible and efficient way to control access to related credentials and share them with users and groups as needed.
