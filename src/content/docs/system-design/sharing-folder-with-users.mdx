The sequence diagram below shows how a user can share a folder with other users.

## User Selection

1. The user selects the folder  and initiates the share process.
2. The client sends a request to the server to fetch the credential fields for the folder.
3. The server returns the required credential fields to the client.

## User and Access Type Selection

4. The user selects the required users to share the folder with.
5. For each selected user, the user specifies the access type ( read, manager).

## Background Service Processing

6. The client sends the fetched credential fields,assoiciated credential id and users to the background service.
7. The background service sends the credential fields to the WASM module for decryption.
```json
[
    {
        "credentialId": "credential_id",
        "fields": [
            {
            "fieldId": "field_id", 
            "fieldValue": "encrypted_field_value"
            }
    ]
    }
]
```
8. The WASM module, which has the user's private key loaded in memory, decrypts the credential fields.
9. After decryption, the background service sends the decrypted fields to be encrypted using each user's public key to the WASM module.
10. The background service sends the encrypted credential fields back to the client.

```json
[{
    "userId": "user_id",
    "credentials":[
    {
        "credentialId": "credential_id"
        "fields": [
            {
            "fieldId": "field_id", 
            "fieldValue": "encrypted_field_value"
            }
        ]
    }
]
}]
```
## Server Processing

11. The client sends the encrypted credential fields, user IDs, and folder ID to the server.

``` json
{
    "folderId": "folder_id",
    "userData": [{
        "accessType": "access_type",
        "userId": "user_id",
        "credentials":[
            {
                "credentialId": "credential_id",
                "fields": [
                    {
                    "fieldId": "field_id", 
                    "fieldValue": "encrypted_field_value"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]    
}]
}
```
12. The server processes the sharing request.
13. The server adds access to the `folder_access` table for the shared folder and users.
14. The server adds access to the `access_list` table for each credential in the folder and the shared users.
15. The server adds the encrypted credential fields to the `fields` table for each user.
16. The server returns the sharing response (success/failure) to the user.

<strong>Note:</strong>
For every user the sharing is success when all the credentials of the folder are successfully shared with the user. So that is made into a single txn.
</div>

<div style="background-color: #23262f; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
<strong>Note:</strong>
From now on, when a new credential is added to the folder, it will be automatically shared with the users who have access to the folder.
